     <h2><strong>Ingredients: </strong></h2>
     <ul>
     <h3><li><strong>For the Chicken Marinade:</strong></li></h3>

          <li> 1 lb (450 g) chicken thighs or breasts, cut into pieces</li>
          <li> 1 cup plain yogurt</li>
          <li> 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
          <li> 1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
          <li> 1 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
          <li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
          <li> Salt to taste</li>

    <h3><li><strong> For the Rice </strong></li></h3>
    <li>2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes</li>
    <li>4 cups water</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>4 cloves</li>
    <li>4 cardamom pods</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>


<h3><li> <strong> For the Biryani</strong></li></h3>
  <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
  <li>A pinch of saffron</li>
  <li>1/4 cup ghee or vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon biryani masala (optional)</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>

</ul>

<h2><strong>Steps to Cooking:</strong></h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong> Marinate the Chicken: </strong> In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, cumin, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.</li>
    <li> <strong>Prepare the Rice: </strong> Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice along with bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, and the cinnamon stick. Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% done (it should still have a bite to it). Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li> <strong>Cook the Onions: </strong>Heat the ghee or oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the onions and set them aside for garnishing.</li>
    <li> <strong>Cook the Chicken: </strong>In the same pan, add the marinated chicken and cook until the chicken is no longer pink and the spices are well-cooked. Add the chopped tomatoes, half of the chopped coriander, and mint leaves. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the mixture is well-blended.</li>
    <li> <strong>Layer the Biryani: </strong>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice. Spread the chicken mixture evenly over the rice. Top with the remaining rice. Sprinkle the reserved fried onions, saffron-infused milk, and the rest of the chopped coriander and mint leaves. Optionally, sprinkle biryani masala for extra flavor.</li>
    <li> <strong>Cook the Biryani: </strong>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
    <li> <strong>Serve: </strong>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork and serve hot with yogurt or raita and salad.</li>
    <p> <strong>Enjoy your Biryani!</strong></p>
