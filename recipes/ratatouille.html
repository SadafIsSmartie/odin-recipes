<li>1 yellow bell pepper, diced</li>
<li>1 large onion, diced</li>

  <h3><strong>Steps to Cooking</strong></h3> 
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables: </strong>Dice the eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, onion, and tomatoes into evenly sized pieces. Mince the garlic.</li>
    <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables: </strong>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent.</li>
    <li><strong>Add the Vegetables: </strong>Add the eggplant and cook for about 5 minutes until it starts to soften. Then, add the bell peppers and zucchini, and continue to cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the Tomatoes: </strong>Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet, along with dried thyme and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to combine.</li>
    <li><strong>Simmer the Ratatouille: </strong>Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the vegetables simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. The vegetables should be tender and well-cooked, with the flavors fully melded.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Seasoning: </strong>Taste the ratatouille and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add more salt, pepper, or herbs according to your preference.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired and serve hot. Ratatouille can be enjoyed on its own, with crusty bread, over rice, or as a side dish.</li>
