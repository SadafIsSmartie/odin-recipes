     <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Mix the flour and salt in a bowl. Gradually add water and knead until you get a smooth, elastic dough. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
     <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong> In a bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, garlic, coriander, cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>
     <li><strong>Prepare the Mantu Dumplings:</strong> Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 2-3 inch squares or circles.Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each dough piece. Fold and pinch the edges to seal the dumpling.</li>
     <li><strong>Steam the Mantu:</strong> Arrange the dumplings in a steamer, making sure they don’t touch. Steam for about 30-40 minutes until the dough is cooked through and the filling is done.</li>
     <li><strong>Prepare the Yogurt Sauce:</strong>Mix the yogurt with minced garlic and salt. Set aside.</li>
     <li><strong>Make the Split Pea Sauce:</strong> Sauté the onions until soft. Add the tomatoes or tomato sauce, cooked split peas, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes until thickened.</li>
     <li><strong>Assemble and Serve:</strong> Arrange the steamed mantu on a serving dish. Spoon the yogurt sauce over them, followed by the split pea sauce. Garnish with dried mint, fresh coriander, and ground red pepper if desired.</li>
